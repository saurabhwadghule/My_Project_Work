"SAS Project: Uncovering Trends in Patient Data ðŸ“Š"
<br>
In this project, I explored patient trends by diving deep into data processing and analysis using SAS. Starting with data import and quality checks, I refined the dataset with ARRAY, IF-THEN, and DO statements to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Next, I leveraged PROC FREQ and PROC SGPLOT to uncover patterns, focusing on how daily walking steps influence weight reduction over one and two months. The findings offer intriguing insights into the connection between physical activity and weight lossâ€”helping to quantify just how much movement makes a difference!

A hands-on journey into data-driven health insights
