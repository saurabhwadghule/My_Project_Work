# This is my SAS Project

In this project, I conducted a trend analysis for a patient group by importing and checking the data for errors, manipulating the data using ARRAY, IF-THEN, and DO statements as per the needs.

I then used PROC FREQ and PROC SGPLOT procedures to derive outcomes. Specifically, I compared the number of walking steps per day with the weight reduction of participants after one month and two months of starting the study. 

The results of this analysis provide valuable insights into the relationship between physical activity and weight loss.
